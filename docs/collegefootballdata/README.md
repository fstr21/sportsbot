# CollegeFootballData Reference (Local Snapshot)

This folder contains an organized copy of the docs we scraped from https://api.collegefootballdata.com. Use it as an offline reference while we build services around the CFBD API.

## Quick links
- [`quickstart.md`](quickstart.md) – authentication, base URL, and sanity-check call.
- [`games.md`](games.md) – schedule/results endpoint used for snapshots.
- [`games_teams.md`](games_teams.md) – team box score stats for each game (our primary team-context source).
- [`teams.md`](teams.md) – team metadata/endpoints for logos, conferences, rosters.
- [`stats.md`](stats.md) – aggregate seasonal stats helpers.
- [`cfbd_raw.md`](cfbd_raw.md) – unedited OpenAPI crawl for anything not yet summarized.

When adding new notes, link them from this README so the folder stays discoverable.
