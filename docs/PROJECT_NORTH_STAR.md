Project North Star
One-sentence mission

Turn today’s games into clear, trustworthy snapshots that combine the betting lines with recent performance and a simple prediction people can actually use.

What we’re building (plain English)

A daily view of each matchup that pairs odds/markets with recent form.

For select players (e.g., QBs in NFL), show a key market (like passing yards O/U) alongside recent performance.

Add a concise prediction with an easy confidence signal and a one-line rationale.

First delivered in Discord (organized by matchup/channels); later in a web app for subscribers.

Who this is for

People who want a fast, no-nonsense read on today’s slate: the line, recent context, and one clear lean—without digging through fifteen tabs.

Sports scope (now)

NFL: teams and select player markets where appropriate.

NCAAF: teams only (no player items).

What “good” looks like to the user

For each matchup:

Matchup header (who’s playing, when).

Core markets (moneyline/spread/total, plus key player markets where appropriate).

Recent context (short, relevant snapshot of form).

Prediction line (plain statement + simple confidence + one-sentence why).

If something’s missing, say so (don’t guess or fill in).

Tone & principles

Clarity over cleverness. Short, readable, consistent.

Honesty over speculation. If we don’t have inputs, we say so.

Helpful by default. Every section should earn its place on the page.

Repeatable, daily rhythm. Snapshots should feel familiar day to day.

Out of scope (for now)

Code details, data formats, APIs, databases, bots, streaming updates, and long-form modeling discussions.
