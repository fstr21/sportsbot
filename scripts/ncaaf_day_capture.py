NCAAF Day Capture Script

Prompts for date → schedule + odds (teams only) + team stats → artifacts

This script captures a full day's worth of NCAAF data including:
- Game schedule from CollegeFootballData
- Betting odds from SportsGameOdds
- Team statistics from ESPN

Note: NCAAF POC does not include individual player statistics.

Outputs structured JSON artifacts and human-readable summary.
